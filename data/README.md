## Data Collection

The *B. mori* sequences were collected from NCBI using accession numbers from the supplementary data of Sun *et al*, 2012. Donor sequences were collected from NCBI using accession numbers provided in Zhu *et al*, 2011. 

### B.mori sequence validation
The B. mori HGT sequences are verified as potential HGTs unique to B. mori by using BLAST to determine homology with other insects, and eukaryotes generally. To test this, first pre-set BLAST parameters are used to do an a BLAST search with the *b. mori* nucelotide sequence that is unrestricted to any organism within the nr/nt database. Then word size and E value parameters are relaxed in order to exclude the possibility of rapidly diverging eukaryotic genes. This is done by reducing the word size to 20 nucelotides, and increasing the E value threshold to 20. List of hits are evaluated to see if any matches returned reflect actual genes, or only map partially to other areas of non-bmori genomes. 

### Donor sequence validation
Donor genes are verified as present in the recipient, *B. mori*, by using donor protein sequences to BLAST against the *B. mori* genome using the non-redundant protein sequences database.


Note: the original paper uses e-value cut-off of 10^-10 and a continuous overlap threshold of 33% (i.e. there is a continuous segment of overlap between the query and hit sequences that stretches at least 33%). These criterion are used to detect for the presence of similar genes in invertebrates.
