## Codeml output

The codeml output files for each gene indicate the pairwise comparison results between recipient and donor for eachg gene. The last two lines in each file show the final values of interest:

S = number of synonymous sites
N = number of non-synouymous sites
dS = synonymous substitution rate
dN = non-synonmous substitution rate
