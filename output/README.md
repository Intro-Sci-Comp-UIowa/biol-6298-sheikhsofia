## Codeml output

The codeml output files indicate the pairwise comparison results between recipient and donor for each gene. The last two lines in each file show the final values of interest:

S = number of synonymous sites  
N = number of non-synouymous sites   
dS = synonymous substitution rate   
dN = non-synonmous substitution rate
